PieSlice - A juicy navigation in AS3 | 2o1o
------------------------------------

This class can be used to generate an interactive sliced pie navigation
and is released under the Creative Commons LPGL 2.1 license.
The slices can be stacked to infinity. A testing sample is contained in the Main.as.
A better documention and some ASDoc have to be done.
The API is not currently set in stone yet.
Developed with Flash develop.

PieSlice uses TweenLite for animations. (www.greensock.com)

Basic usage
-----------

var motherSlice:PieSlice = new PieSlice();
motherSlice.size = 60;

var childSlice:PieSlice = new PieSlice();
motherSlice.addSlice(childSlice);

var subChildSlice:PieSlice = new PieSlice();
childSlice.addSlice(subChildSlice);

and so on...


Coloring
--------

The coloring system is quite simple, there are the color itself, three method options,
represented in static constants, the modification percentage and a reverse colors option.

- sliceInstance.color = 0xFFFFFF;
The color can be set individually for every instance of a Pie Slice,
gradients are generated automatically with the differnt color methods.

- PieSlice.colorMethod = COLOR_BRIGHTEN | COLOR_DARKEN | COLOR_NORMAL
The method can be changed at any time and affects all slices to asure a constant look.

- PieSlice.colorMethod = PieSlice.COLOR_BRIGHTEN | PieSlice.COLOR_DARKEN
This generates a light gradient from the set color to a brighter or either darker version of that color.
The brightening/darkening factor can be set with the colorModificationPercent attribute.

- PieSlice.colorMethod = PieSlice.COLOR_NORMAL
This displays the plain color, colorModificationPercent has no effect.

- PieSlice.reverseColors = true|false;
As default the generated gradient is displayed  from left to right, with the set color to the left
and the brighter/darker version to the right. This flips the colors.

You have to play around with those options to find your favorite coloring.


Sizing
------

The size attribute affects the radius of a slice when it's opened,
child slices inherit the size of their parent. The width, respectively the angle
for a slice can be set with the attribute degreeSize.


Have fun Trying!
